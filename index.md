## What is Natia Miscere?

The product of hundreds of hours of cooperative play between a group of friends, Natia Miscere is both a shared world and a highly customised d20 gaming system based off *Paizo Publishing's Pathfinder Roleplaying Game*.

The combat system takes heavy inspiration from franchises such as *XCOM* and hopes to bring a more tactical and nuanced approach to encounters, while supporting a widely varied set of playstyles.
