Creatures turned into terrible half-beasts by the power of The Moon, the Moonspawn are for the most part, mindless animals that feast upon the unwary and unprepared. Their affliction is contagious, transmitted through bite and claw, and those unlucky or weak enough to succumb to the illness become Moonspawn themselves.

Some however, escape this fate and manage to retain their sanity. Their bodies are forever changed - as bestial as the lesser creatures, but entirely possessed of their own intelligence.

The Moonspawn is an extremely agile, high-mobility melee fighter that specializes in fast assaults and single-target assassinations at close range.

They progress via a unique system based on points awarded for surviving encounters.
